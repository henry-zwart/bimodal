# Analysis and visualisation of bike counter data in Wellington

## Data Sources

Data is imported from the [WCC transport projects website](https://www.transportprojects.org.nz/cycle-data/#showdata/electronic/all/2023-08-01) by DVC. It does look as though the file URLs may be changed occasionally, so this approach might need to change.

We are currently tracking annual raw count data files in CSV format from 2018-2023.
